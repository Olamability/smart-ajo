# SMART AJO – FULL PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

## Product Name
Smart Ajo (Working Name)

---

## Problem
Traditional ajo systems fail due to lack of enforcement, transparency, and trust, leading to defaults, delayed payouts, and social conflicts among members.

---

## Solution
An automated escrow-based ajo platform where the system acts as the organizer, holding contributions securely, enforcing mandatory security deposits, applying penalties for defaults, and automatically releasing payouts according to a predefined rotation.

---

## Target Users
- Salary earners
- Traders
- Students
- Cooperatives

---

## Core Features (MVP)
1. User registration & verification (phone/email, optional KYC/BVN)
2. Group creation with rules (contribution amount, frequency, total members, rotation order)
3. Escrow contributions
4. Automated payouts when all members have paid
5. Security deposit enforcement
6. Penalty system for late or missing payments
7. Transaction history and dashboard for transparency

---

## Non-Goals
- Lending
- Investments
- Crypto

---

## Monetization
- The system charges a **10% service fee** per contribution cycle.

---

## Success Metrics
- Group completion rate
- Default rate
- Monthly active users
- Transaction volume

---

## Future Enhancements
- BVN credit scoring
- Insurance-backed groups

---

## Key Clarifications
- **App-as-Organizer:** The system itself manages all payments, collections, and enforcement.
- **Enforcement Model:** Each member pays a security deposit; contributions are held in escrow until all members pay. Defaulting members incur penalties and may lose their deposit.
